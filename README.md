# Ventilation Control System
## A embedded systems metropolia universitiy student project

The system itself consists in a LPCXpresso 1549 microcontroller board with a temperature, humidity and pressure sensor.


###### The Project
The system itself consists in a LPCXpresso 1549 microcontroller board with a temperature, humidity and pressure sensor.

The purpose of the system, however, is to design a proportional control system (feedback system) which works autonomously, independent from human interaction.
